# TweetFier - Randomness in every tweet

This project is created with ReactJs & NodeJs.

## Description

Due to Twitter recommendations, all recent tweets get lost in the feed. So, I have made categories where you will find all recent tweets from famous and popular users. 
It has three categories:
1) Interesting Tweets
2) Techies & Resources
3) Random Tweets

At max, on each page, you will find 10-15 tweets recently tweeted by the users on Twitter.
